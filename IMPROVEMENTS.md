# 🎉 AI Dev Team - Latest Improvements

## ✅ Fixed Issues

### 1. **Context Persistence**
   - ✅ Interactive mode now maintains context across commands
   - ✅ Agents remember previous conversations and decisions
   - ✅ Build on previous work without repeating context

### 2. **File Visibility**
   - ✅ Shows absolute output directory path on startup
   - ✅ Lists all created files after execution with sizes
   - ✅ Shows relative paths in a nice table format
   - ✅ Warns if no files were created

### 3. **Better Tool Call Parsing**
   - ✅ Improved JSON parsing for multi-line content
   - ✅ Better error messages when parsing fails
   - ✅ Clearer instructions to agents on tool format
   - ✅ Debug logging to troubleshoot tool execution

### 4. **Enhanced Interactive Mode**
   - ✅ New special commands:
     - `files` - List all created files
     - `context` - View current session context
     - `reset` - Clear session context
     - `quit` - Exit
   - ✅ Context persists between commands automatically
   - ✅ Clear feedback after each command

## 🚀 How to Use

### **Basic Usage** (One-time commands)

```bash
cd ~/Projects/my-app

aidev "Create a hello.py file" --output . --auto-approve
```

### **Interactive Mode** (NEW - with context persistence!)

```bash
aidev --interactive
```

Then you can have a conversation:

```
Enter requirements: Create a React component for user login

[Agent creates login component]

Enter requirements: Add form validation to that component

[Agent adds validation - remembers the previous component!]

Enter requirements: files

[Shows all created files]

Enter requirements: quit
```

## 📋 New Features Explained

### **Context Persistence**

In interactive mode, the AI team now remembers:
- Previous requirements
- Files that were created
- Decisions that were made
- Architecture choices

This means you can:
1. Create a feature
2. Refine it
3. Add tests
4. Make improvements

All in one session, without repeating yourself!

### **File Tracking**

After each execution, you'll see:

```
📂 Created Files:
┏━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━┳━━━━━━━━━┓
┃ File Path        ┃ Size    ┃
┡━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━╇━━━━━━━━━┩
│ hello.py         │ 234 B   │
│ src/app.js       │ 1.2 KB  │
└──────────────────┴─────────┘

Full path: /Users/bernardo/Documents/GitHub/my-project
```

### **Special Commands**

In interactive mode:

- **`files`** - See what files have been created
- **`context`** - View the full session context (useful for debugging)
- **`reset`** - Start fresh, clear all context
- **`quit`** - Exit gracefully

---

## 🔧 Technical Improvements

### **Better Tool Instructions**
Agents now receive clearer instructions:
- Exact format for tool calls
- Examples of correct usage
- Rules for file paths and JSON formatting

### **Improved Parsing**
- Multi-line JSON support
- Better regex for extracting args
- Graceful fallback if parsing fails

### **Debug Logging**
When tools execute, you'll see:
```
[DEBUG] Executing tool: write_file
[DEBUG] Args: {
  "filepath": "hello.py",
  "content": "print('Hello World')\n"
}
[DEBUG] Tool result: ✅ File written...
```

This helps troubleshoot when files aren't created.

## 📖 Complete Example Workflow

```bash
# Start interactive mode
aidev --interactive

# Command 1: Create initial structure
> Create a Python calculator module with add and subtract functions
✅ Creates calculator.py

# Command 2: Extend it (context preserved!)
> Add multiply and divide functions
✅ Updates calculator.py with new functions

# Command 3: Add tests
> Create pytest tests for the calculator
✅ Creates test_calculator.py

# Command 4: Check what was created
> files
📂 Shows:
- calculator.py
- test_calculator.py

# Command 5: Continue building
> Add a CLI interface using argparse
✅ Creates cli.py

# Done!
> quit
```

---

## 🎯 Testing the Improvements

Try this simple test:

```bash
# 1. Open interactive mode
aidev --interactive

# 2. Create a simple file
> Create a hello.py that prints Hello World

# 3. Check if file was created
> files

# 4. If you see the file listed, it worked! ✅
```

You should now see:
- Absolute path to output directory
- List of created files with sizes
- Context preserved for next command

## 💡 Tips

### **Use Interactive Mode for Iteration**
```bash
# Instead of:
aidev "Create login form" --output . --auto-approve
aidev "Add validation to login form in login.jsx" --output . --auto-approve

# Do this:
aidev --interactive
> Create login form
> Add validation
> Add error messages
> quit
```

### **Use 'files' to Verify**
After each command, type `files` to see what was created:
```
> Create a navbar component
> files
[Shows navbar.jsx was created]
```

### **Use 'reset' for New Projects**
If you want to start a completely new feature:
```
> reset
✓ Session context reset
> Create a new feature...
```

---

## 🐛 Debugging

If files aren't being created:

1. **Check the output directory**
   - Look at the path shown on startup
   - Verify it exists and you have write permissions

2. **Use 'files' command**
   - See if files were created but in unexpected location

3. **Look for DEBUG logs**
   - Check if tools are being executed
   - See what arguments are being passed

4. **Try verbose mode**
   ```bash
   aidev "..." --output . --verbose --auto-approve
   ```
